# MQTT-OctoPrint OBS
Getting stats from the print running into OBS, using MQTT and a webpage that can be locally hosted or on a server.
The web page i made is to use in OBS, as a overlay for a timelapse or just a camera feed with data. But it can be used for whatever you like. 

## Requirements:
- OctoPrint
- OctoPrint MQTT Module (listed in the directory before)
- MQTT Server
- OBS (if you wanna use it for this)
